#when Ruby program crashes after encountering a runtime error or exception, it will produce a wall of text known as a STACK TRACE that is then output in your terminal. 
#The stack trace prints each line of code in your program that was executed before it crashed. 
#The very first line of the stack trace will generally provide the most useful information about the error your program encountered



# .....DEBUGGING WITH puts........
# The easiest and quickest way to confirm your assumptions while debugging is by using puts statements to output the return value of variables, methods, calculations, iterations or even entire lines of code to your terminal.
